# Instructions

the big_picture.md file present at: "/Users/rahilharihar/Projects/OverallAdoptionRate/big_picture.md" has the final goal broken down into pieces, you are never allowed to change that list, you are only allowed to check out the tasks that you have completed, just what you have done... along with checking out the tasks you will also write the meta data about the code you have generated for that given task, that is what files you have written in what directory and in each file..its goals and  what functions you have written ... exact names, and also the inputs and outputs of that functions, so that when you when you are using those functionalities in the future you will have all the context that is required because you will have the names of the functions and the inputs and outputs format everything in detail written in the big picture  MD file. But remember to never ever delete the remaining part of the file because it is your final source of truth. You will only be editing the part of the file that you have worked on in the given task. I will only say start in the beginning and later say continue. always remember to write the test scripts or the dummy scripts that are not required in future in a folder called dummy script. 

very important thing for you to remember is to not make any changes to the database You are only allowed to do read from the database 

always read the documentation of any functionalities you are building from the online docs... like openai documentation when you are writing code for API calls... this is just an exampe, but do the same for everything. using @Web tool

If you are ever stuck in a loop for more than two times in resolving an error, please always remember to use @Web 

During your interaction with the user, if you find anything reusable in this project (e.g. version of a library, model name), especially about a fix to a mistake you made or a correction you received, you should take note in the `Lessons` section in the `.cursorrules` file so you will not make the same mistake again. 

You should also use the `.cursorrules` file as a Scratchpad to organize your thoughts. Especially when you receive a new task, you should first review the content of the Scratchpad, clear old different task if necessary, first explain the task, and plan the steps you need to take to complete the task. You can use todo markers to indicate the progress, e.g.
[X] Task 1
[ ] Task 2

Also update the progress of the task in the Scratchpad when you finish a subtask.
Especially when you finished a milestone, it will help to improve your depth of task accomplishment to use the Scratchpad to reflect and plan.
The goal is to help you maintain a big picture as well as the progress of the task. Always refer to the Scratchpad when you plan the next step.

# Lessons
1. Store procedure calls require specific parameters - we need to pass the FromDate, ToDate, and Tenantid parameters even if they're marked as NULL in the stored procedure definition.
2. The database contains test data for tenant ID 1388, which should be used for development and testing.
3. Before making assumptions about stored procedure parameters, verify them by checking the database metadata (INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PARAMETERS) or the procedure definition.
4. The SP_OverallAdoptionRate_DWMY stored procedure only accepts three parameters:
   - @FromDate (datetime)
   - @ToDate (datetime)
   - @Tenantid (int)
   Despite what was previously documented, it does not accept the Source, BusinessFunction, or Applications parameters.
5. The adoption rate values in the database are percentages (0-100%), not decimals (0-1).
6. When dealing with database values, always handle NaN (NULL) values properly by providing safe conversion methods.
7. For data analysis tasks, certain dependencies like scipy and statsmodels are required for statistical functions. These should be included in requirements.txt.
8. Monthly aggregated data provides clearer trend signals than daily data, which contains more noise.
9. When working with message history for LLMs, ensure all content is properly converted to strings before tokenization to avoid "expected string or buffer" errors.
10. For JSON serialization of custom model objects or datetime objects, implement a custom JSONEncoder that knows how to handle these types.
11. When handling DataFrame results from stored procedures, use DataFrame-specific methods like df.iterrows() instead of directly iterating over the DataFrame as if it were a list of dictionaries.
12. For plotting with matplotlib, specify color formats correctly - use standard color names ('r', 'g', 'b', 'y') or hex codes (#FF0000) rather than custom formats like "orange-".
13. When using statsmodels ExponentialSmoothing, the 'damped' parameter is deprecated - use 'damped_trend' instead for future compatibility.
14. For time series data in statsmodels functions, provide explicit frequency information to avoid the "No frequency information was provided" warning.
15. When handling metric_type parameters in analysis functions, ensure consistent mapping between user-friendly parameter values (like "monthly") and internal field names (like "monthly_adoption_rate").
16. When iterating over dictionaries that might be modified during iteration, create a copy of the dictionary before iteration to avoid "dictionary changed size during iteration" errors.
17. Always ensure variables used in your code are properly imported or defined, especially datetime components like date, datetime, and timedelta.
18. When building a Flask application, carefully separate the API endpoints from the main application file to maintain a clean architecture.
19. For JavaScript-based chart visualization, use Plotly instead of matplotlib for interactive web-based charts.
20. Use consistent error handling and response formatting across API endpoints to provide a predictable interface.
21. In API endpoints, provide default values for optional parameters to ensure the API works even if not all parameters are specified.
22. Store API endpoints in a Blueprint for better organization and easier routing.
23. When implementing a web interface for a chatbot, use WebSockets for real-time communication if possible, or fallback to regular HTTP requests with proper loading states.
24. Always include proper CORS headers for API endpoints to allow access from different origins during development.
25. For a responsive UI, use CSS variables to define a consistent color scheme and styling across the application.

   - Natural language explanations for all predictions

4. **Test Script**:
   - Created `dummy_scripts/test_predictive_analytics.py`
   - Tests all key functionality with real database data
   - Generates plots for all forecasts and scenarios
   - Produces detailed logs of all test results

### Challenges & Solutions

1. **Database Result Format Change**:
   - Challenge: The stored procedure SP_OverallAdoptionRate_DWMY now returns a pandas DataFrame instead of a list of dictionaries
   - Solution: Updated the _get_data method to handle DataFrame rows using df.iterrows() instead of directly iterating over rows

2. **Plot Color Formatting**:
   - Challenge: Matplotlib plot function was failing with a ValueError due to incorrect color format "orange-"
   - Solution: Updated the color specifications to use standard color codes ('y' for yellow) and separated style parameters (linestyle='--') for clarity

3. **Exponential Smoothing Warning**:
   - Challenge: FutureWarning about 'damped' parameter being deprecated in statsmodels.ExponentialSmoothing
   - Solution: Made note to update to 'damped_trend' in a future revision

4. **Time Series Frequency Warning**:
   - Challenge: Warnings about missing frequency information in time series data
   - Solution: Made note to add explicit frequency information when creating time series objects

### Next Steps
- Update the 'damped' parameter to 'damped_trend' in time_series_forecasting.py
- Add explicit frequency information to time series data to eliminate warnings
- Integrate predictive analytics with the chatbot's natural language query processing
- Consider expanding scenario modeling capabilities with more detailed business factors

## Step 10: UI Integration and Final Deployment

### Description
Now that we have built all the major analytical components including database access, data processing, descriptive analytics, diagnostic analytics, predictive analytics, and prescriptive analytics, we need to integrate everything into a unified web interface that allows users to interact with our chatbot and visualize adoption rate data.

### Plan
1. [X] Create a Flask application to serve as the web interface
2. [X] Design and implement API endpoints for all analytics components
3. [X] Build a responsive HTML/CSS template for the chatbot interface
4. [X] Implement JavaScript for chat functionality and user interactions
5. [X] Create Plotly-based chart visualization
6. [X] Implement session management for conversation history
7. [X] Build API endpoints for chart data and analytics
8. [X] Create a run script to simplify deployment
9. [X] Update documentation to reflect the complete system

### Implementation Details
1. **Flask Application**
   - Created `src/ui/app.py` with routes for the web interface
   - Implemented API endpoints for chat functionality
   - Added session management for conversation history
   - Integrated the existing chatbot components

2. **API Endpoints**
   - Created `src/ui/api_endpoints.py` with endpoints for data and analytics
   - Implemented endpoints for chart data, trend analysis, anomaly detection, forecasts, recommendations, and goal setting
   - Added proper error handling and response formatting

3. **UI Components**
   - Created `src/ui/templates/index.html` with responsive design
   - Implemented `src/ui/static/css/styles.css` for styling
   - Built `src/ui/static/js/chat.js` for chat functionality
   - Created `src/ui/static/js/chart.js` for chart visualization

4. **Integration**
   - Connected the UI with the chatbot component
   - Integrated chart visualization with the data analysis components
   - Connected API endpoints with the analytical components

5. **Deployment**
   - Created `run.py` script for easy deployment
   - Updated documentation in `README.md`
   - Updated the `big_picture.md` file to mark completion of all tasks

### Challenges & Solutions
1. **Integrating Multiple Components**
   - Challenge: Integrating the various analytical components (descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, prescriptive) into a unified interface.
   - Solution: Created a clean API structure with well-defined endpoints for each component, allowing the UI to access them in a consistent way.

2. **Managing Environment Variables**
   - Challenge: Ensuring all required environment variables are set for the application to run.
   - Solution: Created a run script that checks for required environment variables and provides defaults for testing.

3. **Real-Time Chart Updates**
   - Challenge: Updating the chart in real-time based on user interactions.
   - Solution: Implemented JavaScript functions to fetch data from API endpoints and update the chart dynamically.

### Final Thoughts
The Overall Adoption Rate Chatbot now has a complete web interface that brings together all of the analytical capabilities we've built. Users can interact with the chatbot using natural language, visualize adoption rate data, and get insights from the various analytical components. The system is now ready for deployment and use.
